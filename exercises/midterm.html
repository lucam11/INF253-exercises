    <p id="question"> Who can vote by mail in Illinois? </p>
      <blockquote>
        Any registered voter can vote by mail in Illinois. No excuse is needed
        since the excuse requirement was dropped in 2009.
      </blockquote>

    <p id="question"> Does Illinois have absentee voting too? </p>
      <blockquote>
        No. Beginning with the 2016 election cycle, Illinois stopped using the term “absentee.” While many voters
        continue to use “absentee” and “vote-by-mail” interchangeably, there is no difference in Illinois.
      </blockquote>

    <p id="question"> How do I apply for a vote-by-mail ballot? </p>
      <blockquote>
        The State Board of Elections website has an <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VotingByMailAgreement.aspx?T=637370905543171699">online system</a>
        that will guide a voter through the process. Users will either be linked to an online application for their local election authority or to a downloadable pdf file with instructions for
        returning it to the local election authority.
      </blockquote>

      <p id="question"> What is the deadline for requesting a vote-by-mail ballot? </p>
        <blockquote>
          The Illinois Election Code allows voters to apply for a mail ballot up to
          five days before an election, which this year means through Oct. 29. However, the State Board of Elections urges any voter considering voting by mail
          to apply for a ballot much earlier, preferably by Oct. 15.
        </blockquote>

        <p id="question"> How do I return my ballot after I get it? </p>
          <blockquote>
            You can mail it, deliver it in person to the office of your local election authority or, in many election
            jurisdictions, drop it in a secure drop box. About half of Illinois election jurisdictions offer the drop box option.
            Check the State Board of Elections website for an <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/VoteByMailBallotDropBoxLocations.aspx?MID=0DjRa0Y9V6U%3d&T=637370908160225449">online list</a>
            of drop box locations.
          </blockquote>

          <p id="question"> What is the deadline for returning a mail ballot? </p>
            <blockquote>
              Ballots sent through the U.S. Postal Service must be postmarked on or before Nov. 3 and must arrive at the
              office of the local election authority by Nov. 17 to be counted.
              Voters can deposit ballots into a secure drop box, where available, until the close of polls at 7 p.m. on Election Day.
            </blockquote>

          <p id="question"> Can someone else deliver my mail ballot in person to
            my local election authority office? </p>
            <blockquote>
              Yes. But the voter and the person delivering the ballot must fill out an affidavit on the ballot envelope
              acknowledging third-party delivery.
            </blockquote>

          <p id="question"> What if I request a mail ballot
            but decide I’d rather vote in person? </p>
            <blockquote>
              If you have already received your mail ballot, take it with you to an early voting site or your polling place on
              Election Day and surrender it to an election judge. Your mail ballot will be voided, and you will receive a regular ballot.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you have not yet received your mail ballot, you will be asked to sign an affidavit certifying you have not
              received your ballot. You will then be issued a regular ballot. If you received your mail ballot but lost it, you
              may sign an affidavit certifying you have not yet voted in this election. You will then be issued a provisional ballot.<br><br>

              If your mail ballot arrives after you have voted but on or before Election Day, you must discard the mail ballot.
              Do not attempt to vote your mail ballot after you have voted in person. Doing so is a Class 3 felony. (And
              because voting systems will not allow more than one vote per voter, your mail ballot will be rejected.)
            </blockquote>

          <p id="question"> I have damaged my mail ballot. What should I do? </p>
            <blockquote>
              Contact your local election authority immediately. If time permits, you may receive a replacement ballot. If
              there is not sufficient time to deliver a new ballot, you can surrender the damaged ballot at an early voting
              location or precinct polling place on Election Day and vote in person.
              <br>
              <br>
              Emergencies like these are why the Board of Elections recommends applying early for a mail ballot and
              returning it as soon as possible.
            </blockquote>

          <p id="question"> Does the voter have to pay postage to mail back a ballot? </p>
            <blockquote>
              This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some provide postage-prepaid envelopes to return ballots, and
              others require that the voter pay for postage. Your mail ballot will contain instructions on postage, which is
              typically about $1.40.
            </blockquote>

          <p id="question"> If I don’t put enough postage on my ballot,
            will it be returned to sender? </p>
            <blockquote>
              No, the U.S. Postal Service will deliver all ballots it receives. Local election authorities are required by law in
              2020 to accept all ballots, even those that arrive with postage due.
            </blockquote>

          <p id="question"> If there is a problem with my ballot after I return it,
            will I have chance to fix it so that it will be counted? </p>
            <blockquote>
              The election authority is required to notify a voter within two days if a ballot has been rejected. If there is an
              issue with a signature, the voter will be given the opportunity to submit a statement that the ballot was
              completed and sent by the voter in order to have the ballot counted. If the ballot is damaged or arrives
              improperly sealed, the voter will be given options including voting in person or reissuing a mail ballot if time
              permits. However, a damaged or unsealed ballot that arrives after Nov. 3 cannot be cured.
              <br>
